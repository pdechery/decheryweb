This is my resume website. I've tried to make it short and simple, yet enjoyable to read, and (why not) a little funny.

There's no JS libraries in use at this version, and I intend to keep this way.

I used LESS as a CSS preprocessor, which I do since the early 2000's. So, nothing too fancy here.

I hope you like it.
